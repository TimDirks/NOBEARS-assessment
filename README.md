# This is Tim's solution based on NOBEARS' assessment case.

To get an overview of how this solution was build step-by-step, take a look at the [list of PR's][1] from oldest to newest.
This should give a timeline of what features were build in what order.

## Preview development mode

To run it, make sure the dependencies are installed before starting the development server.

Keep in mind, at least Node version 17 or higher is required.

```bash
yarn install

yarn dev
```

## Preview production mode

To see the production build, run the build command before the preview command.

```bash
yarn build

yarn preview
```

## The assignment

For more details about the assignment, see the ``NOBEARS-sollicitatie-opdracht.pdf`` file for the full explanation.

Whilst working on this assignment, I came across a few things that I thought could've been set up different. To read those, check out `assignment-feedback.md`
